This folder has the most basic example of a vehicle class, which makes 2 vehicles with Sony speakers and Michelin Tyres.

If a new vehicle has to be made with speakers and tyres of some other company, then we have to rewrite the whole code in Vehicle.java.
Hence, developer is in control of the flow of the program.

Disadvantages:
Everytime a change comes, lots of rewriting the code.
In an enterprise project, there can be 100s - 1000s of classes, for every change we cannot rewrite everything.
Time Consuming.
Prone to human error.
